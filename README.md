# Multiple-servomotor-system-controlled-from-a-remote-machine-through-RS-485-protocol

A remote machine wants to store the performance of different servomotors. Each servomotor is managed by a microcontroller, which are coordinated by a master microcontroller that send the data to the remote machine
